# AP Physics 1920 Documents
A collection of the lab reports and simulations completed for AP Physics 1920.

### Lab 1
A lab on rotational dynamics and rolling motion, or, [_Energy and Fluid Interactions in Rolling Cans_](https://github.com/ryli123/SPH4U0/blob/master/Lab%20Finals/1/Chourasia%2C%20Li%2C%20Lin%2C%20Ye%2C%20Zhao%20-%20Lab%201%20Final.pdf).

### Lab 1B
A C++ simulation that describes the motion of stress ball collisions in three dimensions, given their spring constants/functions. Read the [report](https://github.com/ryli123/SPH4U0/blob/master/Lab%20Finals/1a/lab1b.pdf) or check out the [code](https://github.com/ryli123/Lab1B).

### Lab 2
A lab for modelling the motion of a pendulum at small angles with damping coefficient considerations, achieved using differential equations and more. Reported under [_Exploring the Character of Simple Pendulums_](https://github.com/ryli123/SPH4U0/blob/master/Lab%20Finals/2/Lab-2-Final.pdf).

### Lab 3
An investigation into the characteristics of DC circuits with resistors, capacitors, diodes, and transistors. Includes a regression of the V-i curve (potential difference vs. current) of a circuit with a PN-junction diode. Results in [_Exploring DC Transients and Semiconductors_](https://github.com/ryli123/SPH4U0/blob/master/Lab%20Finals/3/Lab%203%20Final.pdf).

### Lab 4
Experiments carried out for AC circuits, as well as transformers and solenoid magnetic fields. Made some cool observations on Lissajous figures of circuits with oscilloscopes. Also produced a magnetic field visualization for skew solenoids using MATLAB and the Biot-Savart Law. Read about [_An Analysis of AC Currents and Electromagnetism_](https://github.com/ryli123/SPH4U0/blob/master/Lab%20Finals/4/Lab%204%20Final.pdf).

### Lab 5
Did some work with diffraction patterns, luminance, and blackbody radiation. Tried to regress for Planck's constant with 8% error. Read about [_Quantum Mechanical Effects of LEDs and Lasers_](https://github.com/ryli123/SPH4U0/blob/master/Lab%20Finals/5/lab-5.pdf).
